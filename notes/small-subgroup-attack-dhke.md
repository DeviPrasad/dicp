https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_theorem_(group_theory)

Named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who discovered it in 1845.

In group theory, Cauchy's theorem states that if G is a finite group and 
p is a prime number dividing the order of G (the number of elements in G), 
then G contains an element of order p.

This means there is x in G such that p is the smallest positive integer 
with xp = e, where e is the identity element of G. 

The theorem is a partial converse to Lagrange's theorem, which states that 
the order of any subgroup of a finite group G divides the order of G. 
In general, not every divisor of |G| arises as the order of a subgroup of G.

Cauchy's theorem states that for any prime divisor p of the order of G, 
there is a subgroup of G whose order is p, which is the cyclic group 
generated by the element in Cauchy's theorem.
